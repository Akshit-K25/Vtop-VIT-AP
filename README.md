# Vtop-VIT-AP
This is for the VTOP (student portal of my college of VIT-AP). This is a new design look for our vtop recreated by me using web development (HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery)
The Html and CSS files are named with same words.
Red.html is the login page for vtop.
Start.html is the Starting page of where we gt the options like login to vtop, parent login and spotlight.
2Test.html is from where the actual code starts. It is the main page which we get after login.
The other files are named as per the name of the options and buttons provided in the main page as per the convenience.
The dark mode, side bar, arrow animation and functionality in the side bar and the drop dow profile menu is in the end of the code of almost every file.
